Overview
--------

When querying data with ScyllaDB, you begin by establishing a connection to the database using the appropriate drivers for your programming language. Once connected, you'll utilize ScyllaDB's powerful CQL (Cassandra Query Language) to interact with your data. This involves writing queries to retrieve, insert, update, or delete data, while taking advantage of ScyllaDB's high-performance and distributed architecture. Efficient querying in ScyllaDB also includes understanding and leveraging its primary key design and indexing features to optimize data access. This process is crucial for effectively managing and retrieving data, making ScyllaDB a robust solution for real-time big data applications.
